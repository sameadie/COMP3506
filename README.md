# COMP3506
Two assignments developed for Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP3506) in Semester 2, 2018 at the University of Queensland. These assignments were developed in Java without the use of the Java Collections Framework (JCF) and focussed on the time and space complexity of the implementation.

## Assignment 1: Air Traffic Management System
Developed a Cube ADT and IterableQueue ADT in the context of an air traffic management system

## Assignment 2: Searching The Complete Works of William Shakespeare
Developed searching capabilities for The Complete Works of William Shakespeare which included
+ Word count
+ Single word search
+ Prefix search 
+ Contiguous phrase search
+ Boolean search logic (AND, OR, NOT)

For this, the following ADTs were developed:
+ ArrayList
+ HashMap
+ HashSet
+ HashPair
+ Trie
+ Pair
+ Triple


These assignments also analysed the spacial and runtime complexity of each method.
